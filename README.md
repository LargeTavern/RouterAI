# RouterAI

[‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md) | English

A (work in progress) robust AI model router providing unified access to multiple AI providers through a standardized OpenAI-compatible API interface. RouterAI implements intelligent routing, failover mechanisms, and rate limit handling to ensure reliable access to AI models.

## Why RouterAI?

RouterAI stands apart from alternatives like OneAPI and FastChat by focusing on these key aspects:

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Built with pure Node.js, requiring no complex dependencies or runtime environments.
- **Smart Routing**: Implements intelligent failover between providers when rate limits are hit or errors occur.
- **Production Ready**: Handles retries, rate limits, and provider-specific error cases robustly.
- **Standard Format**: All provider responses are normalized to match OpenAI's format, making it easy to switch providers.
- **Zero Lock-in**: Easy to extend with new providers through a simple provider interface.
